## Application
Took me few hours to get to know with CLI and libraries for node to work with.
Implementation is simple as that. I found on the internet that there are better and quicker solutions.
But from lack of time I sticked to the first that was efficient enough and had tested.

### Usage
 ```sh
 search-ranges -N <amount>
 pressing Q will terminate the application. 
 ```
